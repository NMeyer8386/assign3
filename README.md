## Mobile App Design Assignment 3: Simple Simon

This is a simpler version of the classic memory game "Simon" in which coloured
buttons light up in a progressively longer sequence until the user either gets the combination
correct, or they enter the wrong combination and lose.

To install this app with expo, just run 'git clone https://github.com/NMeyer8386/assign3.git' in the director you'd like to save the project in.   
After the repository is cloned sucessfully, cd into the project directory and run 'npm install'. That will install all
needed dependencies for the project.

## How to use the application

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with 2 options, 'Start Easy' or 'Start Hard'. 
The easy difficulty is a 5-colour sequence and the hard difficulty is 10 colours with 
faster blinks. The buttons are disabled during the blink sequence to prevent cheating but take a 
second or two to re-enable so don't be too hasty!
